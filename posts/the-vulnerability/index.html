<p><em>&ldquo;A vulnerability is a weakness in software or hardware that can be <strong>exploited</strong> by an attacker to compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the information damaging systems and users.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>But what it means <em>weakness</em>, <em>exploited</em> related to vulnerabilities?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the first one, weakness, it seems a very abstract meaning and could be understood in multiple ways, but how this concept can be identify in the real world of vulnerabilities?</p>
<p>The Cambridge Dictionary defines a weakness as:</p>

<p>Personally, to better understand this concept i would like the add the word <em>resistant</em>, in software or hardware, that means that certain functionality is not prepared for certain scenarios and for that has a unexpected behavior.</p>
