Gartner definition of Cyber Threat Intelligence

_"Evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and actionable advice, about an existing or emerging menace or hazard to assets that can be used to inform decisions regarding the subjectâ€™s response to that menace or hazard"_

In order to exist a threat, needs to be a combination between three main concepts:

- **Intention**, _what_ the adversary wants from our organization.
- **Capability**, _how_ the adversary can damage our organization
- **Opportunity**, _how_ the adversary can gain access to our organization

This questions must be answered first with _yes_ or _no_.

- Has the adversary the intention to gain access to our systems?
- Has the adversary the capability to do so? (APT, ransomware, hacktivists)
- Has the adversary the opportunity to gain access to our systems? (vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, poor security awareness among users, shadow IT, etc.)
