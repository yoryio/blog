In my daily job I had heard a lot the word *vulnerability*, but i wonder if we know the real definition about what it's exactly a **vulnerability**.

Today I'll share my thoughts about we need to know and some important additional concepts.

First, let's start with a definition about what is a vulnerability:

### Vulnerability

> *"A vulnerability is a weakness in software or hardware that can be **exploited** by an attacker to compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the information damaging systems and users."*

But what it means *weakness*, *exploited* related to vulnerabilities?

Personally, to better understand this concept i would like the add the word *resistant*, in software or hardware, that means that certain functionality is not prepared for certain scenarios and for that has a unexpected behavior.

This explanation can be related of what is we know also as **Bug**, so again let's start with a simple definition:
