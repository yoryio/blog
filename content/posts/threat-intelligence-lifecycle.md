If we skip entire processes of the cycle, we can be at risk of having more questions and useless information. We need to identify and recognize the importance of each process, beginning with:

- ***Direction***, where the _requirements_ and _questions_ are established to be solved by the intelligence analysts.
# 
- ***Collection***, where the _data_ necessary to answer the requirements and questions is gathered. Always document the _source_ where the data is collected. Also this a _process_, so you can have rounds of collection. Gather many data as possible.
# 
- ***Processing***, where we make our data collected _useful_ and _usable_ to be analyzed. Common ways to process data are:
	- **Normalization**, make an uniform format on how the data will be. XML, JSON, CSV, etc.
	- **Indexing**, we need to be able to search quickly and efficiently our data.
	- **Translation**, when the data is in foreign languages we need to translate into a language we understand and also understand the context of that data.
	- **Enrichment**, gathering data of our data can give us more visibility of what we are looking for.
	- **Filtering**, filter the useful information for each investigation.
	- **Prioritization**, the data needs to be ranked.
	- **Visualization**, can be represented in dashboards where the information can be easily visualized.

- ***Analysis***, is an _art_ and a _science_. We compare all the data gathered and compare against any other data. Evaluate and structure the information, identify connections and make _assessments_ and _predictions_. Our **main goal** is answer the questions produced in the **Direction** phase and can be translated in the form of a _intelligence report_ or answering _yes_ or _no_. Identify and clearly state any _information gap_, so decision makers can be aware of the blind spots. If necessary go back to the **Collection** phase.
# 
- ***Dissemination***, _shared_ with the stakeholders the contextualized answer to the questions posed in the first phase. Intelligence failures often occur because a failed dissemination and needs to personalized dependent on the audience. _Usable_ and _relevant_ to our stakeholders.
# 
- ***Feedback***, in this phase we can be sure if our analysis answers the questions successfully or not and _continuing_ with our intelligence efforts. In both cases the cycle can be repeated to answers more questions or improve our previous analysis.
